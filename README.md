# Mission-to-Mars

## Environment
Python 3.7.3  
Anaconda 1.9.0  
Conda 4.12.0  
Jupyter notebook 6.1.12  
Pandas 1.3.4  
Splinter 0.17.0  
Flask 1.1.2  
Bootstrap  
MongoDB 5.0.9  
HTML5 1.1

## Overview
The purpose of the project is to write a scrip that can gather all the information about the Mission to Mars into one central and convenient location. Once the information is gathered, it will be polished using *Bootstrap* shown to others using *Flask*. 
The plan is to build a responsive web application that will scrape new data every time we want. A *Python* scrip should be able to navigate the web pages to collect the right information which will be stored in a *MongoDB*.
